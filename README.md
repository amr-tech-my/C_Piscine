C Programming Practice Repository
This repository documents my journey of learning \*\*C programming fundamentals\*\* through structured, hands-on exercises. The goal is to build strong foundations in programming, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking â€” starting from zero technical background.  

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
- Develop practical programming skills from the ground up.  
- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking through daily exercises.  
- Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate continuous learning.  
- Create a foundation for future studies in software development and computer science.  

ðŸ§  Skills Being Developed

Core Programming Concepts\*\*  
- Variables, data types, operators, control flow  
- Functions, modularity, recursion

Memory & Pointers
- Arrays, strings, pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`) 

Data Organization  
- Structs and simple data handling  
- Basics of algorithms and problem decomposition  

Software Practices  
- Debugging and testing
- Clean, standard-compliant C code  
- Version control with Git \& GitHub  

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
- `Basics` â†’ introductory exercises (syntax, variables, operators)  
- `Control-Flow` â†’ loops, conditions, simple algorithms  
- `Functions` â†’ modular programming, recursion  
- `Pointers` â†’ arrays, memory management  
- `Strings` â†’ string manipulation utilities  
- `Projects` â†’ larger challenges combining multiple concepts  

ðŸš€ Next Steps  
- Expand into file I/O, sorting algorithms, and data structures.  
- Tackle larger projects that simulate real-world programming challenges.  
- Continue documenting progress and reflections to track growth.  

ðŸ“Œ Note  
This repository is part of my \*\*self-learning journey\*\* in programming.  
It reflects my commitment to building technical skills step by step, with a focus on \*\*discipline, problem-solving, and continuous improvement\*\*.
